# Obesity Prediction App

Welcome to the Obesity Prediction App! This application is designed to predict the likelihood of obesity based on various features such as demographic information, lifestyle habits, and medical history and can be accessed [here](https://deployment-7kb8hpw3fywbpawsy7ljua.streamlit.app/).

## Overview

This project encompasses an end-to-end predictive analysis process, from data collection to model deployment. The key components of the project include:

- Data collection, cleaning, and processing involving over 35,000 entries.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key features and gain insights into the dataset.
- Data preprocessing for predictive analysis, including label encoding for the decision tree algorithm.
- Training a decision tree classification model with 83% accuracy.
- Model evaluation using precision (83%), recall (82%), and F1-score (82%).
- Deployment of the predictive model as an interactive Streamlit application.
- Real-time risk assessment and actionable health insights provided through the deployed application.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Model:** The app utilizes a decision tree classification model trained on demographic, lifestyle, and medical data to predict the likelihood of obesity.
- **Interactive Interface:** Users can input their information and receive instant predictions regarding their obesity risk.
- **Explore Insights:** Explore insights from the dataset through the EDA page, gaining a deeper understanding of the factors influencing obesity.

## Getting Started

To run the Obesity Prediction App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit app by executing `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal.
4. Access the app via your web browser.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can navigate through the following pages:

- **Prediction Page:** Input your demographic information, lifestyle habits, and medical history to receive a prediction regarding your obesity risk.
- **Explore Page:** Explore insights from the dataset, including visualizations and key findings from the EDA process.
